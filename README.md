# Introduction to Computer Science I - Social Network Final Project

A repository containing all of the files for my final Python project for the Introduction to Computer Science I class that I took Spring Semester 2017 at USF. 

The project is a primitive command-line simulation of a basic social network with a text-based menu and user I/O system using a local CSV file to store the network's data in between sessions.
